# SolvegranKSP
Kerbal Space Program 1 planet pack that removes stock system and replaces it with the solvegran system. made in POLSKA.

there (will be) are few versions of this mod
- SolvegranSystem_ADD (adds solvegran system as a far away destination)
- SolvegranSystem_REPLACE (replaces stock system with solvegran)
- SolvegranSystem_8xRESCALE (real life scale, so dagua is slightly larger than earth)
- SolvegranSystem_1xRESCALE (KSP scale, so dagua is slightly smaller than kerbin)
*maybe in future - SolvegranSystem_STORY_MODE (with fauna & flora, missions, wars, entire Daguan space program to do, etc.)
i will be making also expansions for this mod with even more worlds to go to visit (interstellar ship goes nyoomm...)
