# SolvegranKSP
Kerbal Space Program 1 planet pack that adds the vast solvegran system.made in POLSKA.
This is far more expanded universe, this mod is only a representation in KSP

there (will be) are few versions of this mod
- SolvegranSystem_A (adds solvegran system as a far away destination)
- SolvegranSystem_R (replaces stock system with solvegran, home is either set to dagua, keller, alba or eria, as you choose)
- SolvegranSystem_8xRESCALE (real life scale, so dagua is slightly larger than earth)
- *in far future - SolvegranSystem_STORY_MODE (with fauna & flora, missions, wars, entire space program of native daguans to do, etc.)
- I will be making also expansions for this mod with even more worlds to go to visit (interstellar ship goes nyoomm...)

// if you choose to add solvegran system to base kerbol system a pair of connected wormholes will be created, one next to dres, other next to luknok 
// if you install any interstellar expansions wormholes will albo be created 

//story mode has MUCH, MUCH more to explore, tasks, playing through the daguan space program, combat with daguan mythological creatures (and others), exploring the ancient quests
//there is so much of it, i've been designing it since 10 yo, I wrote an entire mythology for dagua, so... maybe i will release it as a book
